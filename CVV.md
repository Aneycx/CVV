### **About me:**

> `I got my first experience of playing the piano as a child. For as long as I can remember, there has always been a piano in our apartment, and my mother often sat down to play it. I listened to all her compositions with great pleasure. And so, when one day my mother identified me: "Son, didn't you learn how to play like that?". A couple of weeks later, at my 7 years old, I went to a music club. The first time I was very busy. I learned notes, octaves, simple melodies. All of this was pretty easy for me. But I learned really beautiful melodies at home, and not at a mug. Having received the basis of musical skills there and having gone there for 3 years, my mother shared her notes with me. At first, seeing all these cumbersome recordings and complex combinations of notes, I did not understand how it could be played. But time has put everything in its place, and now I can easily perform all those compositions, and it will not be difficult for me to learn new.`


## **Last learned songs:**
- Intersteller - Hanz Zimmer
- Fur Elise - Beethoven
- Experience - Ludovico Einaudi
- Still Dre - Dr. Dre and Other

### Sheets exampple:

Below is a fragment of notes from the composition "Experience". In my opinion, one of the most beautiful passages of this work.
